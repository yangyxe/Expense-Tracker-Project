One of our challenges that arised during the project was how our group was not very familiar with github in general, as we had never used GitHub for coding collaboratively. The navigation and all the buttons were a bit strange and a bit overwhelming to look at at first glance, which time, scolling and exploring through the website, figuring out how to navigate it and such, it helped for us to understand what we were working with better. Another challenge was putting all of our codes together, as everyone did a seperate section with a different style of coding. There would be a likely chance for some errors throughout the process, and conflicts throughout the codes. Though through some experimenting, our excellent communication skills and time, we eventually managed to figure out all the mechanics and somehow managed to finish the project on time. Collaborative coding can be pretty convenient, as giving people different roles can split up the work and create more efficiency when working on a bigger project. For smaller projects however, coding individually is more convienent as it's easier to track your own code and you wouldn't have to worry too much about if your code will conflicg greatly with the others. Our group overall thought that collaborative coding was a decent and interesting experience.
